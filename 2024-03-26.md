So, finally, the oscilloscope (which is the proof of concept) has produced results. However, the results were very, very tiny, which is to be expected. In fact, the only way to get any sort of results were with the lights off to eliminate any interference as well as have the photodiode practically touching the cuvette (the housing for the diode was touching the beaker, so they were very very close)

The oscilloscope also had to get zoomed in and adjusted for the waveform to appear, but once this was complete, we were able to get results:![[Pasted image 20240328084449.png]]![[Pasted image 20240328084529.png]]The best results were right next to the pass-through beam, which makes sense based on the diagram for Mie scattering.

In fact, in the middle of the beaker, there was almost nothing to pick up, which makes sense with what would be expected. But next, we need to start obtaining results with the amplifier. Hopefully next time we will begin getting recordable data or at least get close.
