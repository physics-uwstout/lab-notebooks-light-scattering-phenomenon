So today we are starting up the lock-in amplifier and hoping to get it working. For future reference, here is a link to the manual:
[SR830m.pdf (thinksrs.com)](https://www.thinksrs.com/downloads/pdfs/manuals/SR830m.pdf)

So the initial issue is getting the frequency being picked up by the lock-in amplifier (which I think I'm just going to call the LIA) to match the frequency being output by the optical chopper. The LIA is starting off at 1kHz, or 1000Hz, which is about 10 times the current setting of the chopper. It seems like the chopper might be capable of reaching this speed, but it sounds like it's about to take flight whenever I speed it up and I'm just not brave enough to try it. I don't want to be responsible for breaking the optical chopper. So instead, the new focus is to try to change the pickup frequency of the LIA.

Note: the way the LIA amplifies the signal is by using Fourier transforms. Hopefully in future I will have looked this up and have a more in-depth explanation of what that means.

So luckily, there is a really, really easy way to get the LIA to match the optical chopper: literally just connect them to each other. Hook the output on the chopper box to the input for the reference signal. It's instantaneous and updates with any changes on the chopper.

DATA IS APPEARING!

So it works! Like with the oscilloscope, the initial readings are pretty small, but they can be expanded upon using a x10 and x100 button. And after doing a little bit of reorganizing, it seems like we're pretty well set to get started on collecting data.

After some research, it appears that the only viable way of collecting data is manually (for now. Maybe a future group will automate this process?) by recording the angle the photodiode is at from the laser and then determining the resulting amplitude. The manual graphs the data using intensity instead of amplitude for the y-axis, so there needs to be further research done to determine what the calculations need to be to figure out that information. Intensity is unitless so I wonder if it's in reference to the beam's amplitude and if so, it might be a simple matter of percentage lost.
