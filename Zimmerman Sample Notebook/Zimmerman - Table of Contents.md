Below are some sample entries from my lab notebooks.  They can help guide you as to what information you should include in your own lab notebooks.
# Notebook Entries for Chaotic Oscillator
*  [[Mar 4, 2022 - Debugging Mechanical Chaotic Oscillator]]
	* Summary: Jupyter notebook debugging some of the code coming from the MCO box.  Fixed some issues with `float()` but still have an `index out of range` error that needs fixing.
* [[March 9, 2020 - Curve Fitting]]
	* Summary: Jupyter notebook where I took simple data from chaotic oscillator just spinning it and letting it slow down.  Demonstrated how to clean up and fit a curve to the data.  Things are looking promising
* [[March 4, 2020 - Collecting Data from MCO]]
	* Summary: Success!  Jupyter notebook where I was able to get data from the MCO unit.

# Previous Notebook Entries
* [[2017-01-17 Lab Notes.pdf]]
	* Summary: Setting up the Arduino to read data from a photodiode.  I can read the data in through the Arduino software but I need to write a Python script to read and save data
* [[2017-12-12 Lab Notes.pdf]]
	* Summary: Tried to see signs of surface plasmon resonance but was unsuccessful
* [[2017-12-13 Lab Notes.pdf]]
	* Summary: Another look for plasmon resonance.  Was able to see quite clearly with silver slides but it was a little harder to see with gold slides
