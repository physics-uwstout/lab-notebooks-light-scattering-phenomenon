The following shows how to fit a curve in a Jupyter notebook.  I've used the mechanical chaotic oscillator (minus the chaos) to show how to fit a curve.  The notebook can be found in the jupyter notebook subfolder.  You can't access this from within Obsidian, you need to use your normal file browser and open the notebook in Jupyter.


Below is a pdf of the Jupyter notebook:
