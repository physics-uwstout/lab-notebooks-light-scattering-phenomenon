We started setting up our lab, and figured out that we need polystyrene micro-spheres, which we didn't have. We decided to use glass micro-spheres but learned that they were hydrophobic. We instead decided to look over the rest of the lab and research what we are doing. I read about Rayleigh Scattering from "" and how it relates to our lab.
