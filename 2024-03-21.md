So, it turns out I misunderstood the parameters of the experiment a bit. Luckily, this doesn't throw away too much of what was already accomplished. 

The beam being reflected back towards the laser? That has everything to do with the geometry of the container itself. It's also not what needs to be recorded. Neither is the beam that passes through the solution.

In the images of the solution, the solution glows. That light that is being seen from the side? That's what needs to be recorded. It doesn't create any distinct pinpoints of light and, as such, is going to be very, very hard to detect. Which is where the lock-in amplifier comes in. It will be able to pick up the tiny readings recorded from the laser.

I sincerely hope my stumbling around with this for so long will help whoever next picks this up to not struggle as much as I am.

First things first is to, once again, try to pick up a difference using the photodiode and oscilloscope. Unfortunately, there is a lot of background noise that makes the readings difficult to discern. There are a couple of different directions that can be moved in to help get these readings:

-Block out any light during the recording process, either by turning off the lights in the room entirely or by covering the apparatus during readings.
-Get a baseline reading of just the noise and then numerically eliminate the noise to determine what the reading would be with just the laser present.

So far (especially with the use of the optical chopper) there is a visual difference in readings, especially for the smallest angle possible from the pass-thru beam.
