The main note (or home note or however you want to name it) should be the note that links to everything else.  I put "00_" in the title name so it shows up at the top of my file list.  You can also install an plugin called "Homepage" which allows you to set a note as your homepage and adds a button to the right-hand tool bar to go directly to it.
