I had some fears that the solution I left behind and the solution I returned to would be two different things. I covered the beaker with aluminum foil to hopefully prevent it from evaporating. Unfortunately, it appears that isn't what I should've been worried about.

The microspheres almost entirely settled at the bottom of the beaker. This happened in all three solutions (the main source, the beaker with the interim solution, and the end result solution) which I guess makes sense but is a bit concerning. I did my best to mix it together again, but there were pretty obvious chunks floating around during the mixing process. I did my best to get it back to where it was and all I can say to help (since I was using an eyedropper to mix) is to just take it back in and out of the dropper to get it as mixed together as possible. Only time will tell if this isn't effective.

The next step is to make sure we can get an accurate reading. The Lock-In Amplifier is a very fine-tuned piece of equipment and as such, isn't a great way of getting baseline results. So today we used an oscilloscope to get a better feel for starting results.

One of the issues that has been initially encountered is with the angle of reflection. In the sample setup image below:
![[Pasted image 20240229134326.png]]
we can see that the reflected light being dealt with happens at a forward angle, or is less than 90 degrees from the light passing through the beaker. In our case, however, we have completely different results:

The light either passes through entirely or reflect backwards at about 10 degrees from the original beam, or 170 from the forward beam. I guess what needs to be figured out is which beam needs to be observed and will give us details about the microspheres.

There was a concern that this issue might be the geometry of the beaker being used to hold the solution, since it has a cylindrical surface. Just to determine if that is the issue, we pivoted towards using a square-shaped cuvette instead.

Above it can be observed how close to the source the split beam is reflecting. It is the red dot at the edge of the paper.

Some results were taken using an oscilloscope, however it was picking up the results of the pass-through beam. Unfortunately the reflection beam takes place at such an awkward angle it is going to be difficult to place the photodiode in such a way to get good results. However, the results from the pass-through beam tell us something to start with:

This is the oscilloscope with just background noise, no laser.

This is the scope with the pass-through laser. It causes a visible change in the results and changes the peak-to-peak voltage, amplitude, and period. The changes, however, are very small and would be hard to visibly perceive without the aid of the optical chopper. This is why the lock-in amplifier will be so important.

Hopefully, the next step can be to get a reading from the reflected beam and see if there is a significant difference. After that, hopefully the results will be distinct enough that we can determine which beam makes more sense to get readings from and then we can hook up the lock-in amplifier to hone in on the frequency.
