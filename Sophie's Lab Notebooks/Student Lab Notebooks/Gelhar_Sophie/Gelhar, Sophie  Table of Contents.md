Welcome to Sophie's lab notebook on the Light Scattering Phenomena Project, started in the Spring of 2024.

* [[Sophie's Lab Notebooks/2024-02-08]]
	* Summary: A (hopefully) helpful primer of the light phenomena that are being tested and studied during this experiment.
	* Big Question: What are the potential light-scattering phenomena?
* [[Sophie's Lab Notebooks/2024-02-13]]
	* Summary: A stumbling start to getting the experiment set up. Involves developing an understanding of the equipment being used.
	* Big Question: How do we get the experiment set up?
* [[Sophie's Lab Notebooks/2024-02-15]]
	* Summary: Focuses more on the big piece of equipment being used in the experiment: the lock-in amplifier.
	* Big Question: What is a lock-in amplifier?

	* Summary: This is where the experiment really begins. Involves the mixing of the solution.
	* Big Question: How do we set up the experiment?
	[[Sophie's Lab Notebooks/2024-03-05]]
	* Summary: Issues with the lab begin. Beginning to get readings with the oscilloscope. Issues maintaining a consistent solution.
	* Big Question: Are the readings from the oscilloscope what are expected?
