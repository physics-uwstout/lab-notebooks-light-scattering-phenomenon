Welcome to Sophie's lab notebook on the Light Scattering Phenomena Project, started in the Spring of 2024.

* [[2024-02-08]]
	* Summary: A (hopefully) helpful primer of the light phenomena that are being tested and studied during this experiment.
	* Big Question: What are the potential light-scattering phenomena?
* [[2024-02-13]]
	* Summary: A stumbling start to getting the experiment set up. Involves developing an understanding of the equipment being used.
	* Big Question: How do we get the experiment set up?
* [[2024-02-15]]
	* Summary: Focuses more on the big piece of equipment being used in the experiment: the lock-in amplifier.
	* Big Question: What is a lock-in amplifier?
* [[2024-02-29]]
	* Summary: This is where the experiment really begins. Involves the mixing of the solution.
	* Big Question: How do we set up the experiment?
* [[2024-03-05]]
	* Summary: Issues with the lab begin. Beginning to get readings with the oscilloscope. Issues maintaining a consistent solution.
	* Big Question: Are the readings from the oscilloscope what are expected?
* [[2024-03-07]]
	* Summary: Getting some starting results from the oscilloscope. Readjusting the beam. Trying to determine if the initial results are significant.
	* Big Question: Are the results what we're expecting? Or is further adjustment needed?
* [[2024-03-21]]
	* Summary: I finally figure out what data we are actually supposed to be recording.
	* Big Question: How do we collect data from the solution's glow?
* [[2024-03-26]]
	* Summary:  Using the oscilloscope to determine if there are significant readings from the photodiode.
	* Big Question:  What can the readings from the oscilloscope tell us?
* [[2024-03-28]]
	* Summary: Finally breaking out the lock-in amplifier.
	* Big Question: How do we get the lock-in amplifier to read the optical chopper's reference signal?
* [[2024-04-04]]
	* Summary: The solution dries up. Another one has to be made. The data recorded is bad. 
	* Big Question: Why is the data nowhere near what is expected?
* [[2024-04-15]]
	* Summary: Troubleshooting works! Data is finally collected that makes sense!
	* Big Question: What needs to be changed to obtain useable data?
