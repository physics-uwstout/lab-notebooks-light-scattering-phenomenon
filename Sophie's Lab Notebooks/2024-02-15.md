Big Question: What is a lock-in amplifier?

So, there's a lot going on here. The lab setup looks deceptively simple, but it utilizes a Lock-In Amplifier, which is a complex and intense piece of equipment. Hopefully today's notes will give a good idea for how to use the amplifier.

A lock-in amplifier is meant to lock on to a certain frequency and amplify it. It is useful for gathering data because it can lock into a certain frequency, ignore any outside noise, and then amplify it to make the data more readable. In other words, it's like zooming in on a very tiny wave to be able to see the details and is also able to ignore any outside interference. 

The lab describes an automated data collection process involving using LabView and
