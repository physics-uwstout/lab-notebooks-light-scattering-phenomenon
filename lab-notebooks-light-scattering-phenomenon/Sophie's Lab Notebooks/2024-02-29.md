Big Question: How do we set up the experiment?

Luckily, when I came in today, it appeared that John had set up the experiment pretty well.

The one thing that might need changing is the placement of the photodiode. In the experimental setup, the photodiode is placed to collect the reflected light instead of the light that passes through the solution.

The main focus of today, however, was prepping the solution.

It will take some math to find out the concentration of the solution since it took a couple of modifications to make it work (it originally was way too concentrated and the laser was unable to pass through it) so here are the steps taken to finally get a usable solution:

Start: 1 part microspheres, 5 parts liquid (I syringe of)
      +5 syringe water
      -5 syringes of solution (moved to another beaker)
      +4 syringe water
      - 5 syringes of solution
      + 1 water
      SUCCESS

The interesting part about this solution is that the microspheres were created by Dr. Ray and not manufactured, meaning that the properties of the spheres may be imperfect and lead to different results. This also means that the spheres are in a limited supply and need to be conserved as much as possible. To reduce any changes due to contamination and (hopefully) decrease the odds of it evaporating, aluminum foil was used to cover the top of the beaker.

Note: the solution above was made just enough to let light pass through. This may still be too concentrated to obtain adequate results, and further modifications will be detailed if need be.
