Markdown is a lightweight version of HTML (which stands for **h**yper**t**ext **m**arkup **l**anguage) but rather than learning a complicated scheme, you only need a couple of simple symbols.

# Headings

## This is a level 2 heading

# Horizontal Lines
Horizontal lines like the one above can be created by typing three dashes (next to the zero key) on a blank line.
