So unfortunately, all was not well when I returned to the lab. Alas, I was careless with the solution and left it uncovered and unfortunately it evaporated entirely.

I did have a feeling over the past couple of weeks that the amount of solution seemed smaller than I remembered, but I ignored it and unfortunately my intuition was correct. So the solution completely dried up and left a residue of microparticles at the bottom of the cuvette.

I added more water to hopefully dissolve the particles back into a solution, but unfortunately right now it doesn't seem to be anything more than a bunch of large flakes floating in water. Fortunately we have particles to spare but I'm still going to leave the old solution in water to see if they can come back from being completely dried up.

In other news: data was taken! And plotted!

Results don't seem to match the expected...at all.

To be entirely honest, the data gathering method was an experiment in itself. The goal was to have every measurement taken at the same distance away from the cuvette, so I pivoted the photodiode around a protractor, but doing it in the dark by myself was difficult. Might be worth getting a different wire for the photodiode as it got snagged and didn't bend the best in the initial angles. This meant the diode wouldn't stay and had to be held by hand, which was difficult. 

Maybe instead of moving the diode to premade angles, I'll get the measurement and make a pencil mark to determine the angle it was at later?

I guess the hard part is making sure the diode stays the same distance away from the cuvette for every reading? And also making sure its pointed at the cuvette the entire time. Wish I could get like a little turntable or something. Might ask Zimmerman about that.

I guess the other point of concern is that the reading at 0 degrees, where the pass-thru laser is literally going into the diode, was not the highest value?

I'm hoping to get many more readings in the time left in the semester, hopefully getting nearer to the expected. Or at the very least, I hope to develop a better method for data gathering.
