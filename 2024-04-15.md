**TL;DR of this page: less concentrated solution, use the inner circle of the optical chopper, turn off the lights and eliminate as much light pollution as possible. Oh, and cover the solution because if the solution dries up, the microspheres become unsalvageable.**

Collecting data has been really difficult so far. Unfortunately, it seems like the lock-in amplifier isn't capable of obtaining legitimate results while the light is the room is on. Light pollution is having a significant impact on the results, so I had to come in when the room was empty so I could turn the light on and off without disrupting anyone else.

Even with this, the first two test runs still came up with wonky results like the results from [[2024-04-04]] so clearly there needs to be more of a change. The second test run was done an inch closer than the first and the results seemed nearly the same (note: distance doesn't seem to have a significant impact on the outputting voltage. Not sure if it has an impact on intensity yet.) 

I noticed the beam passing through the solution was pretty weak, so I decided to water it down quite a bit. I also took a quick look and saw that after a week, the original microspheres haven't dissolved into the water again. Not sure if there's anything further than can be done to bring dissolve them, but luckily there's enough microspheres left where I don't need to take time to figure out how to bring the other ones back. Just good to note: cover your solution so this doesn't happen to you. Yeah you have to remove the cover to mix it back up every time you start the experiment because it settles, but its worth it. Also probably a good idea to keep track of the level of the solution to track if its evaporating and isn't covered sufficiently enough.

I also decided to see what would happen if I moved what part of the optical chopper the laser is passing through. This seemed to have the most significant effect, oddly. I moved it to the center circle and suddenly the results were much more significant. 

A good way to see if its working is to see if the results when the pass-through beam hits the photodiode are decently high. If it's not, something is wrong and needs workshopping. That measurement should be the highest by a significant amount. 

Note: since I am working alone, I struggled to get results at first. Hopefully the system will be automated in future, but for now, this was my method:

**Step 1: Move the photodiode to a point on the edge of a compass centered at the cuvette (I moved it in 5 degree intervals)**
**Step 2: Turn off the lights.**
**Step 3: Wait for the number on Channel One to reach relative consistency (this is more difficult the further along you go, as the number jumps around quite a bit. I chose whatever number appeared at least 5 times.)**
**Step 4: Mentally note the number, and turn the light on. Write it down on the notepad (notepad may be best, or have a laptop on the other side of the room so it doesn't cause interference)**
**Step 5: Move the diode another 5 degrees.**
**And repeat.**

I managed to get to 160 degrees before the photodiode got too close to interfering with the beam. I got two experiments done, one at 3 inches away, the second at 2 inches away:

When compared to what you would see from Mie scattering, these results make sense. There is definitely more of a result with scattering forward, but there is definitely some backscatter taking place. If I were able to get closer to 180 degrees, it would probably be more significant. However,  because the original results are so high, its hard to really see the backscatter. So I made graphs 
removing the initial results so the backscatter can be better seen (from 20 degrees onwards):

The trend is much easier to see in the abridged version. More results are going to be needed to better determine what is going on. The plan going forward is to obtain more results, plot them together, and then make a plot of the values averaged out? I also need to look into the calculations to turn the voltage result into intensity and see what kind of impact that has. The results obtained so far don't quite imitate exactly what can be seen in the example found in the Gustavus Adolphus College paper:

To be fair, they have significant more results that I was able to obtain, so that doesn't mean my results are bad, just not as precise. 

Overall, progress is being made, but there's more that can be done. Hopefully future students will be able to get a computer to record results because if it isn't obvious, the current method is tedious and imprecise.
