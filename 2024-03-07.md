Today's intent was to get results from the beam reflecting off of the solution, but before that we wanted to make sure that everything was lined up as finely as possible.

However, this on its own presented an immediate problem. The angle at which the beam reflected is now significantly smaller, to the point where it reflected back onto the HeNe laser itself. While it might be possible to get results off of this, it's difficult enough that we need to ask Zimmerman for guidance before attempting it. Circled below is where the laser reflected back:

This makes the angle even tinier and with adjustments it might even be possible to reflect the laser back into itself. I'm guessing that's not ideal and as such will not be attempting to make the adjustments any more exact before getting advice.

While the reflected beam's results might not be currently obtainable, the passthrough beam's results are still significant. Here are some sample results from the Oscilloscope:

Above are the results with both the solution in place and the chopper activated. These are the results with the experimental setup complete and will be compared to baseline result below.

Above are the results with the beam going through the solution but the chopper turned off. This displays the importance of the chopper, as it makes the results distinct enough to be observed. This was something we were informed of, this is just proving that chopper does what it needs to.

These are the results with the chopper activated but the solution removed. We can see that the peak-to-peak and amplitude are much higher.

Finally, here are the results without the laser at all. This is the background noise being picked up and can be used as a baseline for any obtained results. Hopefully the lock-in amplifier will eliminate this completely.

Since there were quite a few questions needing to be answered this week that couldn't be because of Zimmerman's absence, we had to put a pause on our progress for now. Until then, we plan on taking a deeper look into the research papers provided to see if there is anything further we can learn about the experiment.
